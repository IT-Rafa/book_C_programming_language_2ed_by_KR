## Sentence
Exercise 2-1. Write a program to determine the ranges of char, short, int, and long values from standard headers and by direct computation.
Harder if you compute them: determine the ranges of the various floating-points types.

---

## Answer
Since the calculate the max value of each type depends on the machine, and so far we can´t pass a type as argument, I use differents functions for each calculate. 
it´s all the same but each one with its corresponding type.

To calculate floats rangues, I only use the library. Calculate them is too hard.
