Exercise 1-22. Write a program to "fold" long input lines 
into two or more shorter lines after the last non-blank 
character that occurs before the n-th column of input. 
Make sure your program does something intelligent with very 
long lines, and if there are no blanks or tabs before the 
specific column.
